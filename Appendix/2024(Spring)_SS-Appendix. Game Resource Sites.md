---
## General (Covers *everything*)
* [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/)

	* Art quality may vary drastically.
* [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets)
	* Free and paid assets.

	* A wide array of assets with **consistent art style**.
	* Generally, the art style fits the **mobile game** art style.
	* A lot of useful **utility** art assets, like UI elements and icons.

## Graphics (Sprites, Tilesets, etc.)
* [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/)
	* A lot of high-quality sprites from old games. Useful if you know about the names of those games.
	* This includes images in general, so you can also find background images (in particular, images that support **seamless scrolling**) here. Very useful.
	* You have to crop the sprites out of the sprite sheets you download here, however, because the sprite sheets usually have a lot of additional information. (Use Paint, Photoshop, etc.)
